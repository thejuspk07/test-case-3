# AquaFlow Digital Twin implementation and verification

## Outcome

**PASS:** the browser consumes the FastAPI process's authoritative WebSocket state; REST independently verifies freshness. All four reservoir mappings, gate commands, storm response, eligible historical-replay MPC, SafetyLayer, downstream guard, physical gate applications, terminal D discharge, recovery, WebSocket heartbeat, stale/disconnected states, and the four target viewports were exercised in one end-to-end run. The successful run recorded **44 browser checks**, all passed, with **34 authoritative state frames** and **17 heartbeat frames**. The run used public REST commands and the app's actual WebSocket; it did not inject frontend state.

**Important scope:** this is an operational prototype simulation. The configured A -> B -> C -> D links, routing delays, attenuation, capacities, initial conditions, and release capacities are assumed prototype parameters; they are not verified real-world Kerala hydraulic connectivity or operating setpoints. UI values reflect this configured backend model.

## Verified architecture and provenance

- `python -m uvicorn src.dashboard.api.app:app` starts the FastAPI app. Its startup handler starts the single `GlobalSimulationState.simulation_loop`.
- `GlobalSimulationState` creates `SimBridge`, which loads `src/network_env/topology_config.yaml` and constructs one `ReservoirNetwork`; routes and WebSocket reads share the same `sim_state` object.
- The network config defines Virtual Reservoir A through D / Anayirankal, Ponmudi, Idamalayar, and Idukki. Network topology is A -> B -> C -> D; D is terminal, and its terminal outflow is the downstream reading. Connections apply configured FIFO routing delays and attenuation in `ReservoirNetwork.step`.
- `GlobalSimulationState.step` updates the actual storm-derived inflows, records feature history, runs the frozen LSTM V3 live forecast path, separately computes the advisory GNN, obtains gate commands through `LiveMPCOrchestrator`, applies SafetyLayer and `DownstreamCapacityGuard`, and passes the final commands to `SimBridge.step` / `ReservoirNetwork.step`. The UI maps only adapted authoritative values; it interpolates mesh motion for display.
- The LSTM live path lacks valid water-level/rainfall feature measurements and excludes terminal D from the live forecast. The provenance gate correctly rejects that forecast for control (`FORECAST_NOT_ELIGIBLE_FOR_CONTROL`). UI labels storm input, not measured rainfall.
- `VALIDATED_REPLAY` reads the frozen model's held-out historical predictions for all four reservoirs. Its metadata marks historical validation; it is an eligible controller input but **does not forecast the currently commanded storm**. The GNN remains advisory-only. Hardware routes/telemetry are absent, so sensors and actuator are shown disconnected.
- REST `/api/state` is the health/freshness authority while WebSocket `/ws/state` remains the sole state stream. The UI now requires a valid REST response and identity-bearing state frame before displaying BACKEND VERIFIED; REST, WEBSOCKET, state freshness, source and last received identity/time are separate. Server heartbeat packets contain no state values and keep a paused WebSocket observably live.

## Implementation changes

- `src/dashboard/web/api.js`: independent REST/WS health and state freshness, identity comparison, heartbeat recognition, honest connecting/stale/disconnected states, and command accepted/rejected feedback.
- `src/dashboard/web/index.html`: distinct REST/WebSocket/state/source/last-frame badges; actual backend control reason summary; STORM INPUT naming; 0.35 rising-inflow demonstration command; deeper teal light-theme water.
- `src/dashboard/api/app.py`: state-free WebSocket heartbeat every five seconds, supporting liveness checks during paused simulation.
- `scripts/validate_four_reservoir_ui.py`: full REST/WebSocket/browser scenario, assertions for all gate requests/mesh synchronization, upstream-to-D inflow response, applied control actions and D/downstream response, screenshot and JSON evidence capture.
- `tests/test_twin_presentation_truth.py`: updated command-status test to require REST and authoritative state before connected.
- Previously implemented files remain part of the full change: `src/dashboard/twin_component/state_adapter.py`, `tests/test_stage12_authoritative_twin_state.py`, and `tests/test_twin_missing_telemetry.py`.

No protected scientific/control source or model artifact was edited. SHA-256 hashes for both protected source files and ten captured model artifacts match their before-task inventory (12/12); see `protected_final_check.json`.

## Recorded demonstration values

All flow values below are backend API values in m3/s; reservoir order is A/B/C/D. Storm is the backend command fraction. Gate is applied physical network gate position. The machine-readable snapshots include exact values, provenance and state identity in `recorded_demo.json`.

| Stage | Backend state | Storm | Inflow A/B/C/D | Release A/B/C/D | Applied gate A/B/C/D | Downstream | Controller / Safety / guard | Mass balance |
|---|---|---:|---|---|---|---:|---|---|
| NORMAL | step1-t1 (t=1) | 0.00 | 34.7 / 46.3 / 1041.7 / 0.0 | 23.1 / 40.5 / 868.1 / 1157.4 | 40.0% / 35.0% / 50.0% / 50.0% | 1157.4 | UNAVAILABLE / UNKNOWN / UNKNOWN | PASS |
| RISING INFLOW | step6-t6 (t=6) | 0.35 | 71.2 / 115.7 / 2169.8 / 694.4 | 71.2 / 115.7 / 2169.8 / 231.5 | 40.0% / 35.0% / 50.0% / 10.0% | 231.5 | UNAVAILABLE / UNKNOWN / UNKNOWN | PASS |
| SIMULATION FORECAST BLOCKED | step7-t7 (t=7) | 0.35 | 71.2 / 115.7 / 2169.8 / 694.4 | 71.2 / 115.7 / 2169.8 / 231.5 | 40.0% / 35.0% / 50.0% / 10.0% | 231.5 | BLOCKED / NOT_APPLIED_MPC_BLOCKED / NOT_APPLIED_MPC_BLOCKED | PASS |
| VALIDATED REPLAY AUTO CONTROL | step8-t8 (t=8) | 0.35 | 71.2 / 115.7 / 2169.8 / 694.4 | 71.2 / 115.7 / 2169.8 / 347.2 | 90.0% / 85.0% / 30.0% / 15.0% | 347.2 | ACTIVE / SAFE / PROTECTED | PASS |
| RECOVERY RESET | step16-t0 (t=0) | 0.00 | 0.0 / 0.0 / 0.0 / 0.0 | 0.0 / 0.0 / 0.0 / 0.0 | 0.0% / 0.0% / 0.0% / 0.0% | 0.0 | UNAVAILABLE / UNKNOWN / UNKNOWN | NOT_CHECKED |

The four-step rising-inflow window goes from t=2 to t=6 after baseline: `browser_evidence.json` preserves every response. At t=6 the inflows are A 71.2, B 115.7, C 2169.8, D 694.4 m3/s. AUTO with SIMULATION is blocked with reason `FORECAST_NOT_ELIGIBLE_FOR_CONTROL` and neither Safety nor downstream protection claims an applied evaluation. On the next step with `VALIDATED_REPLAY`, MPC is ACTIVE; its proposal passes Safety as SAFE, the downstream guard reports PROTECTED, and the mass-balance audit reports PASS. D release changes from 231.5 to 347.2 m3/s and downstream equals D terminal outflow. The snapshot is for a simulated prototype with assumed routing/capacity values; it is not a real-world flood-control recommendation.

## Performance and test results

Measured on Microsoft Edge headless with actual Intel(R) UHD Graphics Direct3D11 renderer (`ANGLE (Intel, Intel(R) UHD Graphics (0x0000A78B) Direct3D11 ...)`), not SwiftShader. Three 1-second RAF samples per viewport after stabilization:

| Viewport | Median FPS |
|---|---:|
| 1920 x 1080 | 72.6 |
| 1440 x 900 | 105.4 |
| 1366 x 768 | 112.0 |
| 1280 x 720 | 147.3 |

The targeted integration selection (`test_stage12_authoritative_twin_state.py`, missing-telemetry, WebSocket, AUTO/MPC and four-reservoir coordination) passed **96 tests**. The additional final broad stage 3-19/twin rerun passed 364 tests and failed 2 protected-file clean-tree assertions: `src/controller/mpc_controller.py` and `src/network_env/reservoir_network.py` were already dirty at task start. The full output is retained verbatim in `final-regression-rerun.txt`; the backend/tests did not edit those sources.

## Remaining limitations (NOT VERIFIED or constrained)

- Hardware sensor ingestion and actuator feedback: **NOT VERIFIED**; no live hardware connector/route exists.
- Real-world hydraulic validity and real dam response: **NOT VERIFIED**; four-reservoir cascade and several physical parameters are explicitly prototype assumptions.
- Current-storm forecast eligibility for MPC: **FAIL by design/provenance**, `FORECAST_NOT_ELIGIBLE_FOR_CONTROL`. The validated historical replay is eligible for an operational pipeline demonstration, but is not the storm forecast.
- Independently measured true A -> B -> C -> D arrival-lag propagation: **NOT VERIFIED**. The browser run verifies backend-reported inflows at every reservoir and terminal D response; the existing network FIFO routing delays are prototype assumptions, and this run does not wait for a separate water parcel to traverse each configured delay.
- Full regression all-green: **FAIL** due only to the two pre-existing dirty-protected-source guards described above. Other selected regression tests pass.
- Visible, headed on-screen rendering on a separate professor/demo machine: **NOT VERIFIED**. GPU renderer measurement was made on this Windows Intel UHD device in headless Edge.

## Follow-up presentation pass (2026-10-01)

- `src/dashboard/web/index.html`: inter-reservoir channel ribbons now use the authoritative `controlled_release` field. Spill remains represented separately by the backend-spill-driven spillway ribbon; total release is no longer mixed into the directed controlled-release channel.
- Added a restrained downstream operator banner driven only by the backend downstream status. WATCH/WARNING is shown as a watch state. ALERT/HIGH RISK/DANGER/CRITICAL states display **DOWNSTREAM ALERT · Operator notification required · NOT CONFIGURED**; no notification is sent or implied.
- Idukki's larger relative basin and dam scale was already present in the scene geometry (largest `rx` and dam span) and was retained. This is a visual relative scale, not a claim of geographic scale.
- JavaScript module syntax check: **PASS** (`node --check --input-type=module`). Focused UI/presentation and Stage 12/18 pytest selection: **51 passed**, 32 warnings.
- Fresh live-browser verification for this follow-up: **NOT VERIFIED**. The host-managed browser inventory was empty in this session, so no fresh render, focus-mode interaction, camera preset, or runtime performance observation was possible. The browser evidence above is from the earlier implementation run and is not evidence for this follow-up change.
- Backend and scientific/controller source files were not changed in this follow-up.
