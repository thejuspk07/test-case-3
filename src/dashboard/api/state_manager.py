#: ── STAGE 9 — EXPLICIT FORECAST INVENTORY ───────────────────────────────────
#: Live reservoirs that the frozen LSTM V3 live pipeline does NOT forecast.
#: For these, ``LiveForecastAdapter`` emits an explicit ``FORECAST_UNAVAILABLE``
#: record (``issue = MISSING_FORECAST``); the value is never invented. The
#: Stage 7 provenance gate therefore blocks the coordinated four-reservoir MPC.
#:
#: This is a deliberate, named policy — not a silent ``continue`` — so the
#: absence of a D forecast is auditable rather than looking like legacy
#: "don't touch D" behaviour.
LIVE_FORECAST_EXCLUDED = ("Virtual Reservoir D",)

#: ── STAGE 18 — FORECAST SOURCE SELECTION (opt-in; default is unchanged) ──────
#: Which forecast source is allowed to feed the controller.
#:
#: ``SIMULATION`` (DEFAULT — the behaviour every existing test pins)
#:     The frozen LSTM V3 model run on the LIVE simulation's own state, using
#:     explicitly-labelled synthetic placeholders for the two features the live
#:     simulation cannot legitimately produce (``water_level`` in metres,
#:     ``rainfall`` in mm). Because those inputs are NOT real measurements,
#:     ``LiveForecaster._resolve_input_provenance`` correctly reports
#:     ``DEMONSTRATION_ONLY`` / ``validated_metrics_apply = False``, and Reservoir
#:     D has no live forecast at all (``LIVE_FORECAST_EXCLUDED``). The Stage 7
#:     provenance gate therefore BLOCKS the MPC, AUTO reports ``AUTO_BLOCKED``
#:     and the CURRENT gates are held. That is the honest live behaviour and it
#:     is deliberately NOT changed by this stage.
#:
#: ``VALIDATED_REPLAY`` (explicit operator selection)
#:     The frozen V3 model's own predictions on its held-out REAL historical test
#:     split, read READ-ONLY through ``V3ForecastAdapter`` from the SAME artifact
#:     ``scripts/run_phase15_3_validation.py`` consumed. The inputs to those
#:     predictions are real measurements, so the V3 evaluation metrics genuinely
#:     DO apply to them and the Stage 5 contract legitimately reports
#:     ``VALIDATED`` / ``validated_metrics_apply = True`` for all four reservoirs.
#:
#:     The provenance gate is NOT bypassed, relaxed or special-cased: it is
#:     genuinely satisfied, and the real MPCController -> SafetyLayer ->
#:     DownstreamCapacityGuard chain then produces the FINAL_SAFE_CONTROL_ACTION
#:     that moves the gates.
#:
#:     These are HISTORICAL replay forecasts, NOT forecasts of current live
#:     conditions. The payload states that explicitly
#:     (``replay_is_historical_not_live = True``) and the twin displays it.

#:   AUTO_READY            AUTO armed, but no control decision has been made yet.
#:   AUTO_BLOCKED          the provenance gate refused the forecast; gates HELD.
#:   AUTO_ERROR            the controller could not run (UNAVAILABLE).
#:   AUTO_CONTROL_APPLIED  the controller ran and its safe action moved >=1 gate.
#:   AUTO_RUNNING          the controller ran, required no gate change, loop advancing.

        The old loop was ``step(); broadcast(); sleep(1/sim_speed)``, so the
        real period was ``1/sim_speed + computation_time`` — at speed 1.0 the
        twin updated every ~1.28 s instead of every 1.0 s, and the gap grew
        with controller cost. This version advances a deadline by one period
        per authoritative step and sleeps only for the REMAINING time:

            next_deadline += 1.0 / sim_speed
            sleep(max(0, next_deadline - now))

        * When the system keeps up, the cadence is ``1/sim_speed`` — at
          speed 1.0 that is approximately one authoritative step per second.
        * If a step overruns its deadline, the loop does NOT run catch-up
          steps, does NOT duplicate or skip authoritative steps, and does NOT
          burst: the missed slot is dropped, the overrun is recorded, and the
          schedule resumes from the next period. The authoritative state
          therefore remains exactly one step per iteration.
        * Physics, controller timing semantics and `sim_speed`'s meaning
          (steps per second) are unchanged: only WHEN the sleep happens moved.
