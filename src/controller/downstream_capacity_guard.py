"""Finite-search downstream-capacity guard using the authoritative daily physics.

The terminal flow includes controlled release and terminal spill. Upstream spill
is an explicitly separate outlet in this model. Routing queues are copied.
Candidates obey gate bounds and per-day movement limits. Lower gates are NOT a
proof of lower future peaks: early releases can create headroom before arrivals.
A failed finite search is NOT proof of global infeasibility. FAILED_CLOSED is a
legacy status name: it means capacity protection was not established, not that
flooding has been prevented. The least-peak tested admissible action is returned.
Predictions assume held local inflows and held gates; they are not flood guarantees.
