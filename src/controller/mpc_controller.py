"""Deterministic MPC-style coordinated reservoir controller.

Searches one constant gate vector over a cloned daily network trajectory, applies
only the first daily action, and replans at the next step. Six nominal gate
levels across four reservoirs give 1,296 vectors before movement filtering.
The objective prices spill, terminal capacity excursions, storage-band deviation,
unnecessary releases and gate movement. Physical bounds come from the simulator;
live downstream feasibility is checked separately after optimization.

Live configuration: eight daily offsets 0..7, current inflow at offset 0, model
point forecasts at 1, 3 and 7, explicitly interpolated scenarios between anchors.
Only movement-feasible vectors are scored. The live orchestrator independently
rescores the final action after downstream correction.

Default configuration: preserves the original three-step historical benchmark
for reproducibility. Its third step uses the day-3 point on the next daily step;
that legacy timing convention is NOT the live configuration. The unused legacy
day7_headroom_factor is retained solely for configuration compatibility.
